## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
* Properly adjust TypeScript types, create global types file
* Enchance design, create Theme context
* Study formik and yup libraries, implement optional input logic with yup.lazy method
* Create typed structure for inputs, and map inputs from that structure, make it reusable
* Extract validations, and validation messages into separate structure for further multi-language implementation
* Install eslinter for cleaner code

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
* I would implement same logic with ContexProviders, for better understanding of TypeScript types
* I would implement simple 'edit' button, which would load PatientsDetails into form.
