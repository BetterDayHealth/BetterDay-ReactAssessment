# Better Dayâ„¢ Health React Coding Assessment

## Overview

Please write a simple React application.

The purpose of this assessment is to assess your skills and approach to composing a simple web app given an API feed.

Please contact us, if you have any questions.

## What to do?

Your goal is to implement a simple React application, where users will be able to view a list of patients, view profiles, and edit patient information.
You have to create a minimalistic layout, but the UX/UI is totally up to you. The only requirement is to use the `material-ui` package.

You can reuse this API sample, but the structure of the `api/data.json` file must be the same.

Also, create a new `.md` file and add very short info for the following:

- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

Once you complete implementation, please send us the link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...). Alternatively, you may submit your code as a ZIP file too.

## How should the application work?

The user of this react application should be able to view profiles and modify their data.
The application should have the following workflow:

1. Choose a patient from the list.
2. Preview all patient profile data.
3. Press edit to load the form with patient data.
4. Provide a "Save" button that updates data to the `api/data.json` file.

## Requirements

- All code must be written using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) (interfaces, types, etc.).
- Ensure that every package has TypeScript types.
- It will be nice if the design will be responsive.
- Implement some examples of class and function React components.
- Use [formik](https://formik.org/) package for forms.
- Use [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) package for design.
- Use [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/web) package for routing.
- Use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) package for JSON database.

Everything else is up to you.

## How to start?

This project is just an example. It's your choice to create a new project or modify this sample.

## API Usage

API can be launched using `yarn run start-api`.

All API requests and models are defined in `./src/api` directory.

| Method | Endpoint                | Result                       |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| GET    | `/patients`             | List all available patients. |
| PUT    | `/patients/{id}`        | Update patient.              |
| GET    | `/patientsDetails/{id}` | Get patient details.         |
| PUT    | `/patientsDetails/{id}` | Update patient details.      |

More info about API usage can be found at the [json-server repo](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
